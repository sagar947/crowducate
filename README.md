Once Meteor is installed, make sure you [install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Crowducate
--------
Now you can clone and run the application with the following commands:
* `git clone https://github.com/sagar947/crowducate.git` - Clone the repository
* `cd crowducate` - Change into the sourcecode directory
* `npm install` - Install NPM dependencies
