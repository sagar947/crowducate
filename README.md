### Original prototype
* [Original project](http://crowducate.me)
* [Original sourcecode](https://github.com/Crowducate/crowducate.me)


Installation
============

Meteor
------
This application is built with [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com). You will need to have Meteor installed.

Install Meteor on:
* [GNU/Linux or Mac OSX](http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/)
* [Microsoft Windows](http://win.meteor.com)

Git
---
Once Meteor is installed, make sure you [install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Crowducate
--------
Now you can clone and run the application with the following commands:
* `git clone https://github.com/crowducate/crowducate-platform.git` - clone the repository
* `cd crowducate-platform` - change into the sourcecode directory
* `meteor` - run the application

You should now be able to visit the running app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
